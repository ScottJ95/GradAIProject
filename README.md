# Checkers A.I. Alpha-Beta Iterative Deepening

This is a Checkers A.I. semester project for Graduate Level Concepts in Artificial Intelligence. 

The A.I. uses Alpha-Beta Pruning with Best Move First Ordering with Iterative Deepening. There is also a quiesence search performed on the leaf nodes.

## Running It

Just download the files and either compile/run them directly through the Driver class, or run the executable JAR on the command line.

``` java -jar GradAIProject.jar ```

You should be able to import the project in IntelliJ IDE as well. 

If you try to just run the JAR directly it won't work since there is no graphical interface.

When running, the program may use quite a bit of memory. (upwards of 3 GB) please be aware of this.

Javadoc is also included.

### Prerequisites

Any Java runtime that supports Java version 1.8 is required.

Ensure that your PC can handle the potential high memory usage.
